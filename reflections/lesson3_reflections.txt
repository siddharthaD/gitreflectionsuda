When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Mainly for collaboration and let the world see the magic we create. Contribute to it if needed.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    We might not always work on the same version of the code. If Git automatically does that then the changes we want to do will be lost.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks and clone work almost the same way except fork is created on github rather than locally. When you clone a repository you are coping the repository from github to local system.
    Branch is version of the repository which you created inorder to test some bug or test some feature.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
